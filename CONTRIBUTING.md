# Contributing to FableCut

Thanks for your interest in FableCut! This is a zero-dependency, single-purpose
project, and contributions of all sizes are welcome — bug reports, new
transitions, filter presets, animated SVG starters, docs, or core engine work.

## Ground rules

- **No runtime dependencies.** FableCut ships as plain HTML/CSS/JS + a Node
  standard-library server. Please keep it that way — no `npm install` should ever
  be required to run the editor. Dev-only tooling in `devDependencies` is fine if
  it earns its place.
- **One compositor.** Preview and export share the same `drawFrame(t)` code path.
  Any visual feature must render identically in both — never fork the renderer.
- **Match the surrounding style.** Terse, no framework, no build step. Look at how
  neighbouring code reads and follow it.

## Getting set up

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ronak-create/FableCut.git
cd FableCut
node server.js        # → http://localhost:7777
```

Requirements: **Node 18+**, a Chromium-based browser, and (optional but
recommended) **ffmpeg on PATH** for fast export and upload remuxing.

## Where things live

| File | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `server.js` | HTTP server: static hosting, REST API, SSE, ffmpeg export pipeline |
| `app.js` | The editor — timeline UI, compositor, keyframes, text engine, SVG rasterizer, chroma key, exporters |
| `index.html` / `style.css` | Single-page UI + dark theme |
| `mcp-server.js` | stdio MCP server exposing the editor to AI agents |
| `CLAUDE.md` | The agent manual — schema, semantics, recipes. **Keep this in sync with any schema change.** |

## Making a change

1. Fork and branch from `main` (`git checkout -b my-feature`).
2. Make your change. Keep commits focused.
3. **Sanity-check the JS** before pushing:
   ```bash
   node --check server.js && node --check app.js && node --check mcp-server.js
   ```
   Then open the editor and confirm your change renders in **both** preview and a
   test export.
4. If you touched the `project.json` schema, props, transitions, text anims, or
   the API, **update `CLAUDE.md` and the `README.md` feature list** in the same PR.
5. Open a pull request against `main` using the PR template. Describe what changed
   and how you verified it.

## Adding common things

- **A transition** — extend the `TRANSITIONS` array and `applyTransition()` in
  `app.js`. Transitions modulate evaluated props; keep them deterministic so they
  export identically.
- **A filter preset** — add an entry to `FILTER_PRESETS` in `app.js`.
- **A text animation** — add to `TEXT_ANIMS` and handle it in `drawText()`.
- **An animated SVG starter** — drop a self-contained `.svg` into `library/svg/`
  following the conventions in
  [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md#authoring-animated-svgs-the-svg-clip-kind) (use `--d` for
  staggered delays, CSS `@keyframes` only — never SMIL).

## Reporting bugs & requesting features

Use the issue templates. For bugs, include your OS, browser, Node version, and —
if relevant — a minimal `project.json` that reproduces the problem.
